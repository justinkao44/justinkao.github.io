In 2024, I earned my Associate of the Society of Actuaries (ASA) designation. Over the past few years, I successfully completed the following requirements: Exam P (Probability), FM (Financial Mathematics), IFM (Investment & Financial Markets), SRM (Statistics for Risk Modeling), LTAM (Long-Term Actuarial Mathematics), STAM (Short-Term Actuarial Mathematics), PA (Predictive Analytics), VEE in Economics and Mathematical Statistics, and several application modules.
