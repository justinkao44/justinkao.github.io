I am a Statistics PhD student at the [Department of Statistics, George R. Brown School of Engineering and Computing, Rice University](https://statistics.rice.edu/). My research focuses on Bayesian methods, time series forecasting, predictive inference, and differential privacy, with application interests in quantitative trading and actuarial science.

Currently, I work with [Dr. Jerry Reiter](https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~jerry/) at Duke University on *Bayesian and Frequentist intervals under differential privacy for binomial proportions*. Our work will soon be submitted to a journal.

In addition to my academic research, I am collaborating with my colleagues at Duke, [Holly](https://hollyyfc.github.io/) and Alex, on a side project involving coding and computation. Further details will be announced soon.
